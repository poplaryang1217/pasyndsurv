Model Description Short: A KNN model to forecast the number of new
COVID-19 Cases

Model Description Long:

 - Model assumptions
   KNN model classifies data based on the similarity measures to its neighbors. 
   Neighbor = similar data trends in different counties
   K (number of neighbors) = 5
   Distance metrics: euclidean distance
   Build upon the ARIMA model

 - Model pros and cons
   Pros:
     - KNN is a simple algorithm that is easy to understand and interpret.
     - The model classifies the data based on their closeness, and each dataset learns from each other. We train our model by backtracking. 
       We also plan to apply different distance metrics to evaluate the forecasts.
   Cons:
     - KNN can be sensitive to noise, surveillance data tends to be noisy
     - Previous upswings in number of recorded cases could be swaying our forecasts to be sloping upwards
   
 - What data sources did you use
   PA DOH, CDC, JHU, and Covid tracker.

 - What variables from those data sources did you use. Why?
