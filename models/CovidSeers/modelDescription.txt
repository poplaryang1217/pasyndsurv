Model Description Short: A KNN model to forecast the number of new
COVID-19 Cases

Model Description Long: K Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm that uses the patterns of confirmed cases in counties to predict that of our target county. 

 - Model assumptions
  Model assumes that there is a correlation between the confirmed cases numbers in neighboring counties to our target county. 

 - Model pros and cons
  Pros: useful for nonlinear data
        simple concept and algorithm
        
  Cons: large amount of data
        only applicable when the data is related to the closer database.
        
 - What data sources did you use

 - What variables from those data sources did you use. Why?
